# TangyTimeTable

## Description
TangyTimeTable is an all-in-one event planning assistant that automatically aligns usersâ€™ schedules with their friends and suggests activities based on their shared interests. Furthermore, through personal calendar synchronisation and timely notification reminders, TangyTimeTable eliminates manual back-and-forth messaging and event coordination efforts to help users save time and gain more enjoyment from in-person socialisation.

## Usage

- `cd src`
- `npm run android`
- `npm run ios`

TangyTimeTable has gone through two prototype development stages:
1. Paper Prototype using Balsamiq: [Link](https://balsamiq.cloud/sti0r6/pnyd8ff)
2. High Fidelity Prototype using Figma: [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/I7GMziARoK8euZ8TZevWRK/TangyTimeTable---HiFi-Prototype---Week-7-Deliverable---COMP4511?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=885dPEtNUmxg2T4Q-1)

This is the third prototyping stage, where the design team will be building TangyTimeTable using React Native.
