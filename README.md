# TangyTimeTable

## Description
TangyTimeTable is an all-in-one event planning assistant that automatically aligns usersâ€™ schedules with their friends and suggests activities based on their shared interests. Furthermore, through personal calendar synchronisation and timely notification reminders, TangyTimeTable eliminates manual back-and-forth messaging and event coordination efforts to help users save time and gain more enjoyment from in-person socialisation.

## Usage
To run the project, navigate to the directory and run the following `npm` commands:
- `cd src`
- `npm install`
- `npx expo start`, then press `i` to run the `iOS` option

## Disclaimers
As this is the beta-coded version of the TangyTimeTable prototype, some functionalities do not work yet or rely on hard-coded data. This includes:
1. Social Media & Calendar Accounts Syncing
  - Please use manual sign up/login for the most accurate user experience. Logging in/signing up through social media can cause unexpected errors.
  - As social media and calendar accounts synchronisation is not yet implemented, users' friends list is currently hard-coded.
2. Time Availabilities Selection
  - Same availabilities are applied across all displayed dates due to slow load time issues.
3. Activity & Location Recommendations
  - Activity and location data are currently hard-coded.
  - To demonstrate latter parts of our event planning flow, we have hard-coded 3 events, which all users, once logged in, are automatically a part of.
  - Note that because these events are hard-coded, any changes/planning progress made towards them will **NOT** be saved.
4. Travel Time Suggestions
  - Travel time data is currently hard-coded. This means that the final travel time suggestions are always catered towards All Sorts Indoor Sports Centre.
5. Search
  - Search is not functional yet.
6. Non-Functional Features/Buttons
  - If a feature/button is not functional, an alert will be raised on click to let the user know that it is not available yet.
7. Events and Groups Display
  - The display of groups and events on Home Screen (accessible via Events tab) and All Friends screen (accessible via Friends tab) can sometimes be laggy.
  - When this happens, simply refresh the app to get the most accurate data OR click on another tab (e.g. `Upcoming`), then click on your desired tab again (e.g. `In Progress`).

## Roadmap
- TangyTimeTable's research board can be found in this [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMhHMptI=/?share_link_id=646779823933). The board contains:
  - Solution Brainstorm and Categorisation
  - Persona Journey and Empathy Maps
  - User Story Mapping Diagram
- TangyTimeTable's Information Architecture diagram can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNeIKz_E=/?share_link_id=431567442464).

TangyTimeTable has gone through two prototype development stages:
1. Paper Prototype using Balsamiq: [Link](https://balsamiq.cloud/sti0r6/pnyd8ff)
2. High Fidelity Prototype using Figma: [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/I7GMziARoK8euZ8TZevWRK/TangyTimeTable---HiFi-Prototype---Week-7-Deliverable---COMP4511?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=885dPEtNUmxg2T4Q-1)

This is the third prototyping stage, where the design team will be building TangyTimeTable using React Native.
